<h5>There is  3 levels of difficulty:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Easy</li>
<li>Medium</li>
<li>Hard</li>
</ol>
<h5>There's also  5 genre categories for each level:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Rock</li>
  <li>Pop</li>
  <li>Rancheras</li>
  <li>Hip-hop</li>
  <li>Pop (ESP) *Note: ESP means Espanol(Spanish)*</li>
</ol>

Each difficulty level has at least 5 questions, the user can also quit the game or change game modes! Within these levels, there’s 5 questions the user must select in order to complete that level! Once completed, the user will see a text that says *“Congrats! You’ve completed [difficulty level]: [genre]”*. However, if the user makes a typing error while selecting a level of difficulty or choosing a genre, the user will not be able to play the game. In such case, the user has to run the program again and correctly type a response using the information provided by the computer. Meanwhile, if the user makes a spelling error while playing (answering the questions) it will count the answer wrong and move onto the next question.
